### From the hyperapp repo:

Hyperapp is a JavaScript micro-framework for building web applications.

* Minimal — We have aggressively minimized the concepts you need to understand to be productive while remaining on par with what other frameworks can do.
* Pragmatic — Hyperapp holds firm on the functional programming front when managing your state, but takes a pragmatic approach to allowing for side effects, asynchronous actions, and DOM manipulations.
* Standalone — Do more with less. Hyperapp combines state management with a virtual DOM engine that supports keyed updates & lifecycle events — all with no dependencies.
